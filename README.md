# AutoSammich


## Status Updates
### 6/2/24
* obdii_logger.py is the primary script for CAN testing
* auto_sammich.py is a _rough_ framework for a state machine once I get there.
* gui.py is non-functional on the RPi due to a Linux dependency issue I haven't been able to resolve.
* data_proc.py is just a fake data generator for testing the gui.
